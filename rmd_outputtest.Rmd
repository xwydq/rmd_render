## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## 表格

```{r DT, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(iris)
```


## web plot

```{r plotly, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(iris, x = ~Sepal.Width, y = ~Sepal.Length) 
add_markers(p, color = ~Petal.Length, size = ~Petal.Length)
```
