## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE, results = "asis"}
library(plotly)
p1 = plot_ly(economics, x = ~pop)
p2 = plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~pop)
# plot_ly() doesn't require data frame(s), which allows one to take 
# advantage of trace type(s) designed specifically for numeric matrices
p3 = plot_ly(z = ~volcano)
p4 = plot_ly(z = ~volcano, type = "surface")

if(TRUE){
  cat("\n### 数据简介\n", fill = TRUE)
  plot(rnorm(11))
  p1
  
  cat("\n\n### 数据基本信息\n", fill = TRUE)
  p2
}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here is the **first** Div.

```{r}
str(iris)
```

And this block will be put on the right:

```{r}
plot(iris[, -5])
```
